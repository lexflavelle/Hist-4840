## About the Bookshop
Glad Day Bookshop is the oldest queer bookstore in the world. Founded in 1970, it has bounced around the city’s central-east end for over 50 years; its current home, 499 Church Street, hosts a constant stream of community events from the academic to the ostentatious.

This historic business is not just a bookstore and event space. Join Lex and Nkechinyem as they explore Glad Day’s roots, intentions, and community action. How do we keep queer histories alive? How do we protect each other now, to ensure we get to tell our stories later?

## Shownotes/Bibliography:
This project would not have been possible without Nkechinyem Oduh donating her time to speak with me.
